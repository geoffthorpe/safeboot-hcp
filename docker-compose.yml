# Using this version string helps with some older docker-compose versions that
# we regularly encounter. It also ensures the 'extend' feature works.
version: "2.4"

# NB: use of this file by 'docker-compose' depends on configuration settings
# found in 'defaults.env'. This means you must either;
#
# (a) pass '--env-file=defaults.env' to docker-compose,
# (b) source defaults.env into the environment that will run docker-compose, or
# (c) create a symlink from '.env' -> 'defaults.env' so that docker-compose
#     picks up them up automatically.
#
# We contemplated two alternatives to these requirements;
#
# 1. rename the default settings file to '.env', so that docker-compose would
#    pick it up automatically. Rejected: that would hide the one file that we
#    most want first-time users to find.
# 2. put an '.env' -> 'defaults.env' symlink into version control, so that
#    suggestion (c) is pre-arranged. Rejected: we want the HCP code to pose as
#    few portability and filesystem-specific challenges going forward, and
#    committing symlinks into version control seemed a backwards step in this
#    regard.
#
# PLEASE READ 'defaults.env'!! It not only provides settings, it also provides
# a lot of explanatory content. (Which is the reason this comment is the last
# piece of documentation you'll see in this file.)
