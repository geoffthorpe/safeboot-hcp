Host attributes:

      [*] marks "defaultable" attributes that can be set in the "defaults" section.

  name: string
      This is a label only used by the orchestrator for (uniquely) identifying
      entries in the 'fleet' section and for output/logging. Not to be confused
      with 'enroll_hostname'!
  tpm_path: filesystem path (string)
      Ignored if 'tpm_create' is false. This is the path where the orchestrator
      should find (or generate) the host's TPM, _not_ the path where the host
      expects to find that TPM at! Indeed, all the TPMs the orchestrator
      creates must of course (from its perspective) be at different paths, yet
      it's possible for all the hosts to see their own TPMs mounted at a common
      path.
  tpm_create[*]: true/false
      Whether or not the orchestrator should create/instantiate the TPM. Set
      false if the TPM is created via some other mechanism.
  tpm_recreate[*]: true/false
      Ignored if 'tpm_create' is false. Otherwise, if this is set, the
      orchestrator will always put aside any existing TPM and create a new one.
  enroll[*]: true/false
      Whether or not the orchestrator should enroll the host/TPM if it's not
      already enrolled. Set false if the host/TPM gets enrolled via some other
      mechanism.
  enroll_always[*]: true/false
      Ignored if 'enroll' is false. Otherwise, if this is set, the orchestrator
      should always (re)enroll the host/TPM.
  enroll_api[*]: URL
      Address of enrollsvc 'mgmt' interface/endpoint for enrollment and related
      operations. (The '/v1/add', '/v1/query', [...] suffixes get appended to
      this.)
  enroll_hostname: FQDN (string)
      This is the FQDN of the host that will bind to the TPM and use it for
      attestation.
  enroll_profile[*]: configuration inputs to the enrollment process (string)
      This is a JSON-formatted string, containing fields that are used for some
      of the assets generated during enrollment.
      - GENPROGS: list of asset-generation routines enrollment should run.
      - REALM: for Kerberos-related assets, eg. "HCPHACKING.XYZ"
      - DOMAIN: eg. "hcphacking.xyz"
