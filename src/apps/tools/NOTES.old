# This "caboodle" thing is a little special, relative to the other targets.
# Like hcp/client, it builds an image for use as a synchronous function, rather
# than for running asynchronous services like everything else. But unlike
# client, which provides a synchronous "_run" target to execute a particular
# script, caboodle's "_run" target runs a bash session (and adds the "-t" flag
# to the docker-run invocation).
#
# It is also special in the way it builds. It concatenates all other (relevant)
# Dockerfiles together to form a kind of "union" container. The purpose of this
# is to have an image that can run and which contains within it _all_ of the
# HCP functionality in one colocated entity. For one thing, this allows a more
# traditional "single-host" development environment for messing around with
# scripting, but puts it in one mega container as an alternative to doing it
# literally on the host.
