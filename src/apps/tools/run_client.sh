# TODO: this is a temporary and bad fix. The swtpm assumes that connections
# that are set up (tpm2_startup) but not gracefully terminated (tpm2_shutdown)
# are suspicious, and if it happens enough (3 or 4 times, it seems) the TPM
# locks itself to protect against possible dictionary attack. However our
# attestclient is calling a high-level util ("tpm2-attest attest"), so it is
# not clear where tpm2_startup is happening, and it is even less clear where to
# add a matching tpm2_shutdown. Instead, we rely on the swtpm having non-zero
# tolerance to preceed each run of the attestclient (after it has already
# failed at least once to call tpm2_shutdown), and we also rely on there being
# no dictionary policy in place to prevent us from simply resetting the
# suspicion counter!! On proper TPMs (e.g. GCE vTPM), this dictionarylockout
# call will actually fail so has to be commented out.
