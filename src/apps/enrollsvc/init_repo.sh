# Updates to the enrollment database take the form of git commits, which must
# have a user name and email address. The following suffices in general, but
# modify it to your heart's content; it is of no immediate consequence to
# anything else in the HCP architecture. (That said, you may have or want
# higher-layer interpretations, from an operational perspective. E.g. if the
# distinct repos from multiple regions/sites are being mirrored and inspected
# for more than backup/restore purposes, perhaps the identity in the commits
# is used to disambiguate them?)
