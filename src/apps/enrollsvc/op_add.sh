# - pick an output directory (mktemp -d -u), and store it in EPHEMERAL_ENROLL
# - call attest-enroll with our hooks
#   - our CHECKOUT hook reads $EPHEMERAL_ENROLL and returns it to attest-enroll
#     (via stdout),
#   - our COMMIT hook does nothing (flexibility later)
# - add all the goodies to git
#   - use the ek.pub goodie (which won't necessarily match $1, if the latter is
#     in PEM format!) to determine the EKPUBHASH
# - delete the temp output directory.

# 1. This exception/error/rollback path (necessarily before releasing the lock)

#    reliability/recovery, by trying to force the clone back to its previous
#    state, but we really ought to tell someone what we know before we
#    deliberately try to erase all trace. E.g. if "git reset" is adding loads
#    of erroneously-deleted files back to the checkout, or if "git clean" is
#    removing loads of erroneously-generated junk out of the checkout, that
#    information might indicate what's going wrong.
# 2. More urgently: if our failure-handling code fails to rollback correctly,
#    we _REALLY_ have to escalate! For now, we simply leave the repo locked,
#    which is not the most effective nor appreciated escalation method.
