# parameter of the call must match one of the operations we define here ("add",
# "query", ...). If this matches, we also check that the number of arguments
# provided is an exact match with what we expect/allow. At that point, we will
# pass control the corresponding python script (along with the remaining
# arguments). NB, it is the responsibility of each python script to _validate_
# the arguments.
