#
# A primary KDC consists of;
# - "sub_kdc", with KDC_MODE=primary
#   - an authoritative/writable Kerberos database
#   - the 'kdc' service, whose only (direct) clients are other KDCs.
# - "primary_iprop"
#   - the replication service ('ipropd-master') that secondary KDCs pull from
#   - a restarter loop with logging of any failures
# - TODO: a web API that invokes "kadmin -l".
#
# A secondary KDC consists of;
# - "sub_kdc", with KDC_MODE=secondary
#   - a downstream/read-only mirror of the Kerberos database
#   - the 'kdc' service, used by any/all clients
# - "secondary_iprop"
#   - the replication client ('iprop_slave') that updates the mirror by pulling
#     from the primary KDC
#
# Defining HCP_NO_TRACE leaves stderr as pass-through, otherwise the default is
# that each element uses date-based "$HOME/debug-<tool>-<datetime>" log output
# (which in turn would typically be cleaned up by the "purger").
# Here, it's set for everyone's benefit, so everything jabbers to the console
# by default, and if you comment it out then everything goes to its own
# tracefile(s) instead. You can choose to set it selectively only when
# launching the components you want redirected. Eg. this lets container owners
# choose which of the sub-services they want on the container's stderr (and
# which they wish to ignore or handle by other means).
