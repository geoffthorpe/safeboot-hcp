# We set the current working directory to "/" for a couple of reasons;
# - We want/expect things to work independent of the current directory, so
#   setting it in this way neutralizes the effect of where the caller was when
#   they launched us.
# - When a subprocess drops privileges, the current working directory might be
#   one to which they have no access. E.g. if the shell command 'find' is then
#   executed, it would change working directory as part of its operation and
#   then try to change back - resulting in an error if the original working
#   directory was itself inaccessible.

# What to do depends on the arguments we get. This script is often the
# 'entrypoint' of a container image, though it can be invoked directly (and is,
# in the 'monolith' use-case). If we get cmd-line arguments, they could be for
# this script or for passing along to one of the services we start.
#
# We proceed as follows. We consume arguments for this script until we
# encounter one that is not recognized, or 'custom' which is necessarily the
# last such argument.
#
# This script recognizes;
#     setup start setup-* start-* custom
#
# If the last argument was 'custom' then the remaining arguments are assumed to
# be an arbitrary command-line to be started in the container.
#
# Otherwise, if the first unrecognized argument begins with a "-" character, we
# assume that the current argument (and all that follow it) are intended for
# one of the services. The ".args_for' property identifies which service that
# is. Each service (that isn't setup-only) has an 'exec' property and
# optionally an 'args' property. By default, the two are concatenated into the
# command-line that gets executed. However if arguments are passed along to
# that service from our caller, they are used _instead_ of the 'args' property.
# This means the dividing line between the 'exec' and 'args' depends on what
# arguments you want _replaced_ if the user/caller passes in their own
# arguments. Note, if you want arguments passed to the ".args_for'-identified
# service that don't begin with "-", use "--" as the first argument - as a
# special case, we will consume that argument (not pass it along) but consider
# that all subsequent arguments should be passed even if the first one doesn't
# begin with "-".
#
# Otherwise (ie. when the first unrecognized argument doesn't begin with a "-"
# character), we behave as though the previous argument was 'custom'.
