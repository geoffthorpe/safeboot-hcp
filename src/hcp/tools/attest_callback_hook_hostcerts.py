# This post-processing hook can be invoked from the common attest callback by
# pointing HCP_ATTESTCLIENT_HOOK_HOSTCERTS to it. It allows the owner to
# specify a set of regex-driven rules to apply when processing the HCP-issued
# assets after attestation, and for those assets that match, specify locations
# to copy those files to, and (most importantly) which user the files should be
# owned by.
#
# When invoked;
# - stdin is a JSON document containing an array of assets, as per the pre and
#   post install hooks used with attest_callback_common.py.
# - if HCP_HOSTCERTS_MAPFILE is defined, it must be the path to a file
#   consisting of a JSON list of rules, with each rule being a dict of the
#   form;
#   [
#      {
#         'regex': <regex>,      <-- required
#         'dest': <path>,        <-- required
#         'owner': <username>,   <-- optional, defaults to 'root'
#         'mode': <octalstring>, <-- optional, defaults to '640'
#      }
#   ]
# - otherwise, if HCP_HOSTCERTS_MAP is defined (not "MAPFILE", "MAP"), it must
#   hold the literal JSON text of the same array of rules.
#
# For assets that match a regex, the file will be copied, the owner will be
# modified, and then the destination path will be atomically updated. The rules
# are processed in order, and once an asset has matched, it is not compared
# with any subsequent rules.
