# Although the following is a "local" setup issue (because it gets lost and

# need to do it even before "global" setup occurs, which usually precedes local
# setup. Background: we have constraints to support older Debian versions whose
# 'git' packages assume "master" as a default branch name and don't honor
# attempts to override that via the "defaultBranch" configuration setting. More
# recent distro versions may change their defaults (e.g. to "main"), but we
# know that such versions will also honor this configuration setting, whereas
# the older versions won't. In the interests of maximum interoperability we go
# with "master", whilst acknowledging that this goes against coding guidelines
# in many environments.  If you have no such legacy distro constraints and wish
# to (or must) adhere to revised naming conventions, please alter this setting
# accordingly.

# We use a 3-ply directory hierarchy for storing per-TPM state, indexed by the

# representation of the ekpubhash in text form - 4 bits per ASCII character).

# split of 256. The second ply uses the first 6 characters as a directory name,
# meaning 4 new characters of uniqueness for a further split of 65536,
# resulting in a total split of ~16 million. The last ply uses the first 32
# characters of the ekpubhash, with a working assumption that this (128-bits)
# is enough to establish TPM uniqueness, and no collision-handling is employed
# beyond that. That 3rd-ply (per-TPM) directory contains individual files for
