# By discipline and convention, we do all our bash with "-e", so make sure to
# sponge up any errors that aren't bugs or irrecoverable conditions.
#
# In particular, this service is supposed to handle transient replication
# errors, most likely when the db we're replicating from (or the network)
# vanishes for a while, so we can't let bash abort the script due to an error
# in git-fetch.
#
# On the other hand if something like "cd $HCP_USER_DIR", "cd next", or
# "datetime_log" fails, then the appropriate thing _is_ for bash to kill the
# script and attract the attention of someone to come and investigate.
# (Rationale: in such cases, trying to recover or even endure just adds
# complexity - and new ways for things to go wrong - and is more likely to
# "bury the lede" when someone sifts through the wreckage later trying to
# figure out what happened.)
